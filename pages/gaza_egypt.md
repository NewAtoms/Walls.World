# Egypt - Gaza Barrier

* Type: Anti-illigal immigration
* Built year: 1979
* Lenght: 3 km

The Egyptâ€“Gaza barrier refers to the steel border barrier along the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. Because it is essentially splitting the city of Rafah, the steel barrier is also referred as a separation wall.

In December 2009, Egypt started with help from the US, the building of a steel wall along the Gaza border. If it is finished, the wall will be 10-11 km (6-7 miles) long and extend 18 metres below the surface. The wall was to be completed in 18 months.  - Source: [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt%E2%80%93Gaza_barrier) -
