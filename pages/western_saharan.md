# [Western Sahara Berm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Wall)
* Type: Conflict zone
* Built year: 1987
* Lenght: 2,700 km

The Moroccan Wall of Western Sahara is an approximately 2,700 km-long structure, mostly a sand wall (or "berm"), running through Western Sahara and the southeastern portion of Morocco. It separates the Moroccan-controlled areas (Southern Provinces) and the Polisario-controlled areas (Free Zone, nominally Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic) that lies along its eastern and southern border.

According to maps from the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) or the UNHCR, part of the wall extends several kilometers into internationally recognized Mauritanian territory. (Source: [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Wall))
