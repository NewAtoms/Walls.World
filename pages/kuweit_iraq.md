The Kuwait–Iraq barrier (Arabic: حدود العراق-الكويت‎ Hudud al-'Irāq-al-Kuwayt) is a 120-mile (190 km) border fence extending six miles (10 km) into Iraq, three miles (5 km) into Kuwait, and across the full length of their mutual border from Saudi Arabia to the Persian Gulf. Constructed by authorization of the United Nations Security Council, its stated purpose is to stop a re-invasion of Kuwait by Iraq; particularly after the Kuwait-Iraq 1973 Sanita border skirmish.
