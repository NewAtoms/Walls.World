# Melilla Border Fence

* Type: Anti-illegal immigration
* Built year: 1998
* Lenght: 11 km

The Melilla border fence is a border barrier between Morocco and the Spanish city of Melilla. Constructed by Spain, its stated purpose is to stop illegal immigration and smuggling. Morocco has objected to the construction of the barrier since it does not recognise Spanish sovereignty in Melilla. - Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla_border_fence) -
