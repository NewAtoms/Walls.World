# Walls of the World

In front of you a map of the world obviously, but this one shows mankind’s urge to demarcate their territory. 

A selection of walls whether they are build for anti-illegal immigration, anti drug smuggling or remain conflict zones, they each have different stories. 

This map could be seen as an organism that grows and it wants to evolve, so it’s far from perfect. For now scroll through info stories, read recommended articles and zoom the hack out of it. 

We would be delighted if you can help us improve this map and help her grow. Do you know more stories, locations on [openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) or do you have any valuable info about walls? Pleace let us know by mailing at <helpdesk@newatoms.com>.

* **Disclaimer**: We have no political intention whatsoever. The current selection of walls is random. Our goal is to make a comprehensive map of all the walls of the world.
