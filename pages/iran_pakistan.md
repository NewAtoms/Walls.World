# [Iran - Pakistan Barrier] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Pakistan_barrier)

* Type: Anti-drug smuggling
* Built year: Under construction
* Lenght: 700 km

The Iranâ€“Pakistan barrier is a border barrier, which Iran has started building along its border with Pakistan replacing an intermittent tattered border fence. The 3 ft (91.4 cm) thick and 10 ft (3.05 m) high concrete wall, fortified with steel rods, will span the 700 km frontier stretching from Taftan to Mand. The project will include large earth and stone embankments and deep ditches to deter illegal crossings and drug smuggling into Iran. The border region is already dotted with police observation towers and fortress-style garrisons for troops. (Source: [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Pakistan_barrier))
