# Malaysia - Thailand Barrier

* Type: Anti terrorism
* Built year: 2001
* Lenght: 650 km

The Malaysiaâ€“Thailand border consists of both a land boundary across the Malay Peninsula and maritime boundaries in the Straits of Malacca and the Gulf of Thailand/South China Sea. Malaysia lies to the south of the border while Thailand lies to the north. The Golok River forms the easternmost 95 km stretch of the land border.

The land border is based on the 1909 treaty between Thailand, then known as Siam, and the British which started to exert its influence over the northern Malay states of Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Terengganu in the early 20th century. - Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia%E2%80%93Thailand_border) -
