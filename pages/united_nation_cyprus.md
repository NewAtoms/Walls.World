The United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus is a demilitarised zone, patrolled by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), that was established in 1974 following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and de facto partitions the island into the area controlled by the Government of Cyprus (which is the de jure government for the entire island save for the British Sovereign Base Areas) in the South and that under the administration of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the North. The zone runs for more than 180.5 kilometres (112.2 mi) along what is colloquially known as the Green Line and varying between less than 20 metres and more than 7 kilometres wide has an area of 346 square kilometres (134 sq mi). - Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Buffer_Zone_in_Cyprus) -
